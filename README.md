## Application Overview

Copify is a music catalog application built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf that provides users with an elegant interface to explore albums, songs, and artists. The application features a dark-themed, Spotify-inspired UI with full search capabilities and detailed views for albums and individual tracks.

## Data Model and Relationships

The application is built around two primary models with a clear relational structure:

### Album Model

The `Album` class represents a music album with the following attributes:

- `id` (Long) - Unique identifier
- `name` (String) - Album title
- `artist` (String) - Artist or band name
- `imageUrl` (String) - Cover art URL
- `releaseYear` (String) - Year of release
- `followers` (int) - Number of followers
- `songs` (List<Song>) - Collection of songs in the album

### Song Model

The `Song` class represents individual tracks with the following attributes:

- `id` (Long) - Unique identifier
- `title` (String) - Song title
- `artist` (String) - Artist name
- `album` (String) - Album name
- `albumId` (Long) - Foreign key reference to Album
- `duration` (String) - Song length (mm:ss format)
- `plays` (long) - Number of plays/streams
- `liked` (boolean) - User favorite status

### Relationship Structure

**One-to-Many Relationship**: Each Album can contain multiple Songs, while each Song belongs to exactly one Album. This relationship is maintained through the `albumId` foreign key in the Song model, linking songs to their parent album.

The data layer uses `LinkedHashMap` collections for efficient storage and retrieval, with auto-incrementing sequence counters for ID generation.

## Features

- **Search Functionality** - Real-time search across albums and songs
